might require zipCode=52556 in the url

they don't show prices for most items until they get a zip

Lowes constructs URLS using 2 numbers

First, the item number, then the model number, then this other number which may refer to a store number but I'm not sure


<input type="hidden" name="N" id="N" value="4294612687" />

can be trimmed to
http://www.lowes.com/pd_573299-46-RTW4641BQ_4294685245

the url snippet zipCode=52556 is not present anymore after the first time entering it, but I think it is still present somewhere in POST or however you would say that.

573299-46 is the item number, though 'Item #: 573299' is shown on the page. '-46' is some extra part to the item number. not all products have this.
RTW4641BQ is the model number, and it is shown on the page as 'Model #: 960450046'
4294685245 is the phantom number that needs to be there too, but changes from product to product too, but sometimes only the last couple of digits. '4294' has stayed with me for most products.
this phantom number can be replaced by any number and the page seems to work fine.
